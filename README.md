# Info-3 - To-Do List

Through the process of creating a To-Do List web app, I gained valuable insights into web development basics. HTML taught me how to structure content logically, while CSS allowed me to enhance the visual design. JavaScript added functionality like adding, editing, and clearing tasks. This project underscored the importance of user interaction, such as double-clicking to edit tasks and moving them between lists. It was a practical and hands-on way to learn the core elements of web development and build a user-friendly web application.
